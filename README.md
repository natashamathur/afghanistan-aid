# Executive Summary
Each year the United States distributes $5.9 billion in foreign aid. This money goes to a variety of countries on 
every continent and can be used for anything from education to medical development to infrastructure spending. 
The US is certainly not alone in this; many countries provide funds to their neighbors or allies around the world
When the State Department gives aid, it assumes that doing so will result in actions supporting the agencies' goals at large. 
In Afghanistan, the expected result from giving out military aid is a decrease in insurgent violence. 
The following research suggests that achieving those aims depends greatly on the exact manner in which aid is allocated. 
The statistical findings suggest that military aid for large projects in areas that are already under government control 
is the only funding method that in fact decreases violence. Other situations, such as small projects in both government 
and rebel-controlled regions, seem to increase the overall level of violence as well. 
Therefore, in order to ensure that the aid provided will decrease violence, the data suggests the money should be used for 
large projects in government-controlled area.
